# Performance Tuning

> **STUB: This skill is not yet implemented**
>
> This placeholder preserves the documented plugin structure.
> See parent plugin README for planned capabilities.

## Planned Capabilities

- **Re-ranking**: Cross-encoder reranking for improved precision
- **Query Expansion**: Synonym expansion and query reformulation
- **Semantic Caching**: Cache frequent queries and responses
- Latency optimization strategies
- Throughput scaling configurations
- Cost optimization recommendations

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Core implementation
- [ ] References documentation
- [ ] Output templates
- [ ] Integration tests
