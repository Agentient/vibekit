# Full-Stack Error Tracking with Sentry

This skill provides expertise in observability for the vibekit marketplace.

## Overview

Sentry provides real-time error tracking and performance monitoring across your full stack, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Key Concepts

- **Error Boundaries**: Catch and report React component errors
- **Source Maps**: Map minified code back to original source
- **Release Tracking**: Associate errors with specific deployments
- **Custom Context**: Add user, request, and business context to errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track transaction performance and bottlenecks

## Best Practices

1. Configure source maps for readable stack traces
2. Set up release tracking for deployment correlation
3. Add user context for error attribution
4. Use error boundaries in React components
5. Configure sampling rates appropriately for production
