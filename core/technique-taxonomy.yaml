      description: "Debiased analysis + failure planning + quantified risk"
      use_case: "Strategy review, investment decisions"

  anti_patterns:
    - name: "Analysis Paralysis"
      categories: [perfect_recall, meta_cognitive, parallel_processing]
      warning: "Combining exhaustive techniques can create infinite loops"
      mitigation: "Set explicit stopping criteria before starting"
